# Unisens

Unisens is a **universal data format for multi sensor data**. It was developed at the [FZI Research Center for Information Technology](http://www.fzi.de/en/about-us/organisation/research-divisions/ess-embedded-systems-and-sensors-engineering/) and the [Institute for Information Processing Technology (ITIV)](http://www.itiv.kit.edu) at the KIT (formerly University of Karlsruhe). The motivation for specifying a new data format was the need for a universal, generic and sustainable format for storing and archiving sensor data from various recording systems. Other main requirements were a human readable header and the use of future-proof standards like XML.

For more information please read the [feature list](features.md) and the documentation.

If Unisens meets your requirements, feel free to try it. The Unisens dataformat and the Unisens Libraries are licenced under the LGPL and can be downloaded [in the download section](downloads.md).

We also provide additional tools like a viewer for Unisens datasets (UnisensViewer) and a toolbox for Matlab which you will also find [in the download section](downloads.md).
